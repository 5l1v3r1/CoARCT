# CoARCT
Code Analysis and Refactoring with Clang Tools

This is a placeholder. When LANL approves release of CoARCT example code, it will go here.

## What is it?

CoARCT (pronounced like the word "corked") is a set of small tools built on the Clang tools. It is a chance to show some more sustained examples of refactoring and analyzing code with AST Matchers and the clang Refactoring Tool.
